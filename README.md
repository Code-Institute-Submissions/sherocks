# She Rocks!




For the fourth Milestone Project, I decided to combine two of my passions, fashion and rock music, 
in an e-commerce website. Having a background in high-end retail, I decided to keep the same customer target, 
but specializing in rock chic style clothing.

### :page_with_curl: Navigation Menu

The navigation menu stick to the top of every page. 

In this way, a user can navigate easily even if scrolls down the page.

This is how it looks on larger devices:

On smaller screens the navbar collapses into a hamburger icon:

### Design

### Colour Scheme

At the beginning I wanted to stuck with a black/white palette, but then I thought that a splash of colour was suitable, 
as the style of clothing has character and stands out. 

I opted for a deep pink (China Pink) and a dark purple (Russian Violet). I got the inspiration from cyberpunk digital art.

### Typography

I choosed two fonts that are modern and highly legible: Montserrat and Raleway.

![Raleway](static/readme-doc/raleway.png)


At the beginning I searched for something more out of the ordinary for the titles, but I ended up choosing Raleway.

I didn't want to make the page look too messy and the focus should stay on the pictures.


### Imagery

I got the products images from the brands webpages. I selected the products that I thought would be perfect in this

shop.

The team images has been taken from Unpslash, except for one image that is mine.

The pictures in the home page come from two different websites.

All the links to the images are here: [Images Links](static/readme-doc/Links.pdf)
